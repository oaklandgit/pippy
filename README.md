# What's Pippy?

![IMG_5345](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc9c53af-c0c0-4e9b-b7e8-bcbc421aea37)

Pippy is a compact, text-first Linux computer with a deliciously tactile 47-key mechanical keyboard. It connects to your iPad with a single USB cable, providing the Pippy with its power and display. Pippy returns the favor with a real shell, focused terminal tools, and a satisfying typing experience. Itâ€™s a seamless, symbiotic setup: minimalist, portable, and built for people who love computing at its most intentional.

**Pippy is a work in progress!**

> This project is evolving in the open. Expect bugs, half-built features, and changing plans. Feedback welcome.
