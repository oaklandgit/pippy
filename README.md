Pippy is a compact, text-first Linux computer with a deliciously tactile 47-key mechanical keyboard. It connects to your iPad with a single USB cable, providing the Pippy with its power and display. Pippy returns the favor with a real shell, focused terminal tools, and a satisfying typing experience. Itâ€™s a seamless, symbiotic setup: minimalist, portable, and built for people who love computing at its most intentional.
