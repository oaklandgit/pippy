# Keyboard Chronicles

From the start, the Pippy was meant to be highly portable. But the one thing I would not compromise on is the keyboard.

The biggest downside to comparable devices (Clockwork's [uConsole](https://www.clockworkpi.com/home-uconsole) and [DevTerm](https://www.clockworkpi.com/home-uconsole), are that the keyboards are more geared to thumb typing than traditional touch typing.

I want to type on something that feels, for lack of a better word, _delicious._

The challenge here is to combine a delicious typing experience with a small form factor. So I gave [planck-style keyboards](https://youtu.be/bEPg8kk84gw) a try.

These keyboards have only 47 keys (12 wide, 4 tall, and the space key takes up 2 spaces == 47)

I found a good model (Inland MK-47 from Micro Center) that I could incorporate into my design and I used the great web-based tool [via](https://via.evove.top/) to flash the layout. (Planck keyboards use the concept of "layers" for creating different modes so that one can cram all the necessary keyboard functionality into fewer keys.)

And finally, I'm in the process of making custom keycaps that make it clear to the user how to access that functionality.

You can even order this keycap set yourself at:

I haven't yet ordered these, however, because they don't seem to have a low profile option like the non-custom jobs I've got on the protype currently:
