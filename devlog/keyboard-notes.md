# Designing the Pippy's Keyboard

From the start, the Pippy was meant to be highly portable. But the one thing I would not compromise on is the keyboard.

The biggest downside to comparable devices (Clockwork's [uConsole](https://www.clockworkpi.com/home-uconsole) and [DevTerm](https://www.clockworkpi.com/home-uconsole), are that the keyboards are more geared to thumb typing than traditional touch typing.

I want to type on something that feels, for lack of a better word, _delicious._

The challenge here is to combine a delicious typing experience with a small form factor. So I gave [planck-style keyboards](https://youtu.be/bEPg8kk84gw) a try.

These keyboards have only 47 keys (12 wide, 4 tall, and the space key takes up 2 spaces == 47)

I found a good model (Inland MK-47 from Micro Center) that I could incorporate into my design and I used the great web-based tool [via](https://via.evove.top/) to flash the layout. (Planck keyboards use the concept of "layers" for creating different modes so that one can cram all the necessary keyboard functionality into fewer keys.)

And finally, I'm in the process of making custom keycaps that make it clear to the user how to access that functionality.

You can even order this keycap set yourself at:

UPDATE:

The Inland MK-47 Planck keyboard comes with RGB backlighting and effects. That "gamer" vibe isn't exactly the aesthetic I'm after, but I did want to take advantage of it as a keyboard backlight. And I added legends for the backlight brightness (and volume while I was at it) to the firmware (via Via ðŸ˜‰) and the YUZU keycaps.

However, after I ordered the keycaps, two things occurred to me. For backlighting to work the key caps need to be: 1) shine through and 2) not white! (I have a Logitech MX keyboard with white shine-through caps. The white caps make it impossible to even see the legends when the backlight is on which, needless to say, defeats the purpose! I, however, strive to be more thoughtful in my design!

So I did some more searching and found [FK Keycaps](https://fkcaps.com/) who has low profile keycaps with shinethrough and standard MX stems to fit my existing switches. Just the trick!
